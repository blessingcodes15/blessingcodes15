- 👋 Hi, I’m @Blizbeat
- 👀 I’m interested in software development using java technologies and other generic tools out there.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning smart contract coding with solidity. And I'm also building on my knowledge of incorporating framework such as springboot to build operational architecture for web apps 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blockchain development as it is a new area I'm so much interested in to further diversify my knowledge.
- 📫 Reach me on Twitter (@beatz_bliz)
